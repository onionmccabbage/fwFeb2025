# read a whole file e,g, 40,000 rows by 30 columns approx
# each row may reerence a table with ~100,000 rows

# run pipeline, adds to new DB, or to country ( USA, Canada )
# probably aim to keep keyword csv together

# 1. 40,000 is too many for the website
#    so only go to row x
# 2. read a row from a table, then look up in another table (lots)
#    given a keyword, which page do we expect to rank for this keyword
