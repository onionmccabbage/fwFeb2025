Mini Exercise for 25 mins (until 2:15)

Add another property to the Shape class, for 'dimensions'
This property nees to be a tuple cotaining at least two values
Each value within this tuple must be a postive int or float
You will need:
- a __slots__ member
- an argument in the __init__method
- getter/setter methods

Write a function within the Shape class called '__str__'
(remember it must take 'self' as an argument)
Within this function, return a formatted string where you inject the shape name and sides
e.g. 'This is a square with 4 sides, dimensions 3x5'

Exercise the code by adding a 'dimensions' tuple to the instances
e.g.  s1 = Shape('square', 4, (4,3)) # the (4,3) is the 'dimensions' tuple
